List of projects:
1.	Parallel Implementation of Sieve of Eratosthenes (SoE) Algorithm:
	This project has been done for graduate level course of Parallel Processing in Fall 2011. 
	Here different implementations of SoE algorithm are done for different memory models- 
		1) basic serial SoE algorithm using C 
		2) parallel version of SoE algorithm for distributed memory model using MPI 
		3) parallel version of SoE algorithm for shared memory model using OpenMP
	Performance analysis and scalability of each of the implementations has been done by using large number list (100 million)
